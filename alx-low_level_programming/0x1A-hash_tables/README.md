A hash table or associative array is a popular data structure used in programming. A hash table is just a linked list (I'll get to what a linked list is later on) with a hash function. A hash function basically just takes things and puts them in different "baskets". Each "basket" is just another linked list or something else depending on how you implement it. I'll explain more details on hash tables when I show you how to implement one.
